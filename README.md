# Project-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-

**CodeBook.md** - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the gathered data  

**run_analysis.R** - script which tidies the data gathered and completes the 5 steps required by the project.  
Steps included:   
1. Merging training and test sets into one data set  
2. Extracting only mean and std for each measurement  
3. Descriptive activities instead of code integers  
4. Labeling data sets with descriptive names  
5. Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject  

**data.txt** - data exported after step 5
